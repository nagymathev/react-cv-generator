# Todos for the project

### Very important to break down the app into smaller components for my sanity

---

- [ ] A section for general information like the following:
  - name

  - phone number


- [ ] A section for educational experience:

  - date of study


- [ ] A section for practical experience:

  - main tasks of the jobs
  - date from and until worked at the company


- [ ] To be able to edit the submitted values,
    it should put back the values into the form for editing,
    and then after changes has been made submit it again and
    replace the old values
